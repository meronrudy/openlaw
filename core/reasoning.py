Forward-Chaining Rule Engine and Explanation Generation

Implements legal reasoning over hypergraphs with provenance tracking,
conflict resolution, and explanation generation for transparent legal AI.

- ReasoningConfig(aggregator: str = "min", alpha: float = 0.8)
- RuleEngine(graph: GraphStore, context: Optional[Context] = None, config: Optional[ReasoningConfig] = None)
  - forward_chain() -> List[Node]  # Executes agenda-based forward chaining and returns newly derived facts
- explain(graph: GraphStore, conclusion_id: str) -> Dict[str, Any]  # Produces an explanation object

Compatibility/Contract
- Node.prov.confidence and Hyperedge.prov.confidence are used in aggregation.
- Hyperedge.qualifiers may include: rule_id, authority, priority, rule_text.
- The engine is deterministic under identical graph ordering and inputs.
