DESCRIPTION OF INJURY:
While supervising the installation of HVAC equipment on the third floor, I injured my back lifting heavy ductwork components. The injury occurred in the course and scope of my employment while performing normal job duties. I felt immediate sharp pain in my lower back and was unable to continue work.

CIRCUMSTANCES LEADING TO INJURY:
- Lifting 80-pound sheet metal ductwork with coworker James Miller

- Employer required manual lifting to meet project deadline
- I followed all safety protocols and used proper lifting techniques

IMMEDIATE MEDICAL ATTENTION:

- Diagnosed with herniated disc L4-L5 by Dr. Sarah Kim

WORKERS' COMPENSATION CLAIM FILED:
Date Filed: February 16, 2024
Claim Number: WC-2024-4521
Insurance Carrier: Industrial Safety Insurance
Medical Provider: Metro Orthopedic Specialists

COURSE OF EMPLOYMENT ANALYSIS:
This injury clearly occurred within the course and scope of employment:
1. During regular work hours (2:30 PM shift)
2. At designated work location (construction site)
3. While performing assigned job duties (supervising HVAC installation)
4. Activity arose out of employment (lifting work materials)

MEDICAL TREATMENT REQUIRED:
- Emergency room visit: $2,400
- MRI and diagnostic imaging: $1,200
- Physical therapy (3x weekly for 8 weeks): $2,880
- Specialist consultations: $800
- Prescription medications: $350

Period of disability: 6 weeks (February 16 - March 29, 2024)
Total lost wages: $6,900

EMPLOYER RETALIATION ISSUES:
Following my workers' compensation claim filing, I experienced unlawful retaliation from management:

February 20, 2024:
- Project Manager Steve Davis questioned the legitimacy of my injury
- Made comments about "workers who abuse the system"
- Suggested I was "faking it to get time off"

February 25, 2024:
- Received written warning for "failure to follow safety protocols" 
- This contradicts the accident report showing I followed all procedures
- Warning appeared to be retaliatory documentation

March 15, 2024:
- Upon returning to work with lifting restrictions, assigned to desk duties
- Salary reduced by 20% claiming "reduced responsibilities"
- Coworkers reported supervisor saying "workers' comp claims hurt everyone"

March 22, 2024:
- Excluded from team meetings and project planning
- Passed over for promotion I was previously promised
- Created hostile work environment

WORKERS' COMPENSATION VIOLATIONS:
The employer's actions violate state workers' compensation statutes:
1. Questioning legitimacy of valid work injury claim
2. Creating hostile work environment for filing claim
3. Reducing wages in retaliation for claim
4. Issuing disciplinary actions following claim filing

State workers' compensation law prohibits employer retaliation against employees who file legitimate claims. The timing and nature of these adverse actions clearly constitute unlawful retaliation.

REQUESTED REMEDIES:
1. Full payment of medical expenses ($7,630)
2. Temporary disability benefits for lost wages ($6,900)
3. Reinstatement to full salary and responsibilities
4. Removal of retaliatory disciplinary actions from personnel file
5. Penalty against employer for retaliation
6. Additional damages for emotional distress

WORKERS' COMPENSATION EXCLUSIVITY:
I understand that workers' compensation is generally the exclusive remedy for workplace injuries. However, I reserve the right to pursue additional claims for:
- Intentional infliction of emotional distress through retaliation
- Violation of state anti-retaliation statutes
- Civil rights violations if applicable

SUPPORTING EVIDENCE:
- Emergency room records and medical documentation
- Witness statement from James Miller (coworker present during injury)
- Photos of work site and equipment involved
- Documentation of retaliatory actions by management
- Email trail showing hostile treatment after claim filing

CONCLUSION:
This is a legitimate workers' compensation claim for an injury that occurred during the course and scope of employment. The employer's retaliatory actions violate state law and worker protection statutes. I request immediate processing of benefits and cessation of all retaliatory conduct.
