MEMORANDUM

TO: Human Resources Department
FROM: Sarah Chen, Employee ID: 1234
DATE: March 15, 2024
RE: Request for Reasonable Accommodation under Americans with Disabilities Act

Dear HR Team,

I am writing to formally request a reasonable accommodation for my mobility disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. ยง 12112.

BACKGROUND:
I have been employed as a Software Developer in the Engineering Department since January 2022. I was recently diagnosed with a degenerative joint condition affecting my lower back and legs, which significantly limits my ability to sit for extended periods and walk long distances.

CURRENT CHALLENGES:
My current workstation setup requires prolonged sitting in a standard office chair, which causes severe pain and limits my ability to perform essential job functions effectively. The walk from the parking lot to my office (approximately 200 yards) has become increasingly difficult.

REQUESTED ACCOMMODATIONS:
1. Ergonomic workstation equipment including:
   - Height-adjustable sit/stand desk
   - Ergonomic chair with lumbar support
   - Footrest and monitor arms

2. Modified work schedule allowing:
   - Flexible start/end times to avoid peak commute periods
   - Permission to take short breaks every hour to stretch

3. Preferred parking space closer to the building entrance

ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS:
I can perform all essential functions of my Software Developer position with these accommodations, including:
- Writing and debugging code
- Participating in team meetings (including virtual attendance options)
- Meeting project deadlines and deliverables
- Collaborating with team members

MEDICAL DOCUMENTATION:
I have attached documentation from Dr. Martinez at Metro Orthopedic Specialists confirming my diagnosis and recommending these workplace modifications.

I believe these accommodations would enable me to continue performing my job effectively without imposing undue hardship on the company. I am happy to engage in the interactive process to discuss these requests and explore alternative solutions if needed.

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to working together to implement these accommodations.

Sincerely,
Sarah Chen
Software Developer
