WRONGFUL TERMINATION INCIDENT REPORT
POTENTIAL PUBLIC POLICY VIOLATION

Employee: Jennifer Liu
Employee ID: 9012
Position: Quality Control Inspector
Department: Manufacturing Safety
Employment Period: June 2022 - March 18, 2024
At-Will Employment State: California

INCIDENT SUMMARY:
I am documenting my termination on March 18, 2024, which I believe constitutes wrongful termination in violation of California public policy, despite my at-will employment status. My termination occurred in direct retaliation for reporting serious safety violations to OSHA.

BACKGROUND - SAFETY VIOLATIONS DISCOVERED:
In February 2024, during routine quality inspections, I discovered multiple serious safety violations at our manufacturing facility:

1. Chemical Storage Violations:
   - Hazardous chemicals stored without proper ventilation
   - Missing safety data sheets (SDS) for several substances
   - Improper labeling of chemical containers

2. Equipment Safety Issues:
   - Malfunctioning emergency shut-off systems on production lines
   - Missing safety guards on machinery
   - Inadequate personal protective equipment for workers

3. Fire Safety Concerns:
   - Blocked emergency exits in production areas
   - Non-functional fire suppression systems
   - Overloaded electrical circuits

WHISTLEBLOWING ACTIVITY:
February 28, 2024: I reported these violations to Plant Manager Tom Wilson
March 2, 2024: Wilson dismissed concerns, said "production targets take priority"
March 5, 2024: I filed formal safety complaint with OSHA (Complaint #CA-2024-0342)
March 8, 2024: OSHA confirmed receipt of complaint and scheduled inspection
March 10, 2024: Wilson called me into meeting, visibly angry about OSHA involvement

RETALIATORY ACTIONS:
Following my OSHA complaint, I experienced immediate retaliation:

March 11, 2024:
- Reassigned from quality control to menial cleaning duties
- Access badge restricted from production areas
- Excluded from team meetings and communications

March 15, 2024:
- Supervisor Lisa Chen documented me for "insubordination" for questioning the reassignment
- Placed on "performance improvement plan" despite excellent prior reviews

March 18, 2024:
- Terminated for "performance issues" and "not being a team player"
- Escorted out by security during OSHA inspection preparation

EVIDENCE OF RETALIATION:
1. Performance Reviews: Consistently "Exceeds Expectations" ratings through January 2024
2. Email Trail: Wilson's emails expressing frustration about "troublemaking employees"
3. Witness Statements: Coworkers heard Wilson say I was "causing problems with regulators"
4. OSHA Timeline: Termination occurred exactly 10 days after filing OSHA complaint

LEGAL ANALYSIS:
Although California is an at-will employment state, the public policy exception protects employees from termination for:
- Reporting violations of law to government agencies
- Refusing to violate laws
- Exercising statutory rights (including OSHA whistleblowing)

California Labor Code ยง 1102.5 specifically protects whistleblowing activities. The Occupational Safety and Health Act also contains anti-retaliation provisions under 29 U.S.C. ยง 660(c).

WRONGFUL TERMINATION CLAIM:
My termination violates public policy because:
1. I reported legitimate safety violations affecting worker health
2. OSHA complaints serve important public safety interests
3. Timing shows clear causal connection between complaint and termination
4. Company's stated reasons for termination are pretextual

DAMAGES REQUESTED:
- Reinstatement to Quality Control Inspector position
- Back pay and benefits from March 18, 2024
- Front pay until reinstatement
- Emotional distress damages
- Punitive damages for willful retaliation
- Attorney fees and costs

CONCLUSION:
While at-will employment generally allows termination for any reason, California law prohibits firing employees for exercising their right to report safety violations. My termination clearly violates this public policy exception and constitutes wrongful termination.

I intend to pursue all available legal remedies for this retaliatory discharge.
