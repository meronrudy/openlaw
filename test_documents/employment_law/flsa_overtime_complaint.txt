EMPLOYMENT COMPLAINT FORM
FAIR LABOR STANDARDS ACT VIOLATION

Employee Information:
Name: Michael Rodriguez
Employee ID: 5678
Position: Warehouse Associate
Department: Distribution Operations
Hire Date: August 1, 2023

Complaint Details:
Filing Date: March 22, 2024
Subject: Unpaid Overtime Wages and FLSA Violations

VIOLATION SUMMARY:
I am filing this complaint regarding systematic violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), 29 U.S.C. ยง 207, by ABC Distribution Company. I have been classified as a non-exempt hourly employee earning $18.50 per hour, yet I have been denied proper overtime compensation for hours worked over 40 per week.

DETAILED WORK RECORDS:
Week of March 4-10, 2024:
- Monday: 8.5 hours (7:00 AM - 4:00 PM)
- Tuesday: 9.0 hours (7:00 AM - 4:30 PM)
- Wednesday: 8.0 hours (7:00 AM - 3:30 PM)
- Thursday: 10.5 hours (7:00 AM - 6:00 PM)
- Friday: 9.5 hours (7:00 AM - 5:00 PM)
- Saturday: 6.0 hours (8:00 AM - 2:30 PM)
TOTAL: 51.5 hours

Week of March 11-17, 2024:
- Monday: 9.0 hours
- Tuesday: 8.5 hours
- Wednesday: 9.5 hours
- Thursday: 8.0 hours
- Friday: 10.0 hours
- Saturday: 4.5 hours
TOTAL: 49.5 hours

OVERTIME VIOLATIONS:
1. I worked 11.5 hours over 40 in the first week, entitled to time-and-a-half pay ($27.75/hour) for those hours
2. I worked 9.5 hours over 40 in the second week, also entitled to overtime rate
3. Total unpaid overtime: 21 hours at $27.75/hour = $582.75

ADDITIONAL FLSA VIOLATIONS:
1. Off-the-clock work: Supervisor John Davis routinely instructed warehouse staff to clock out at 4:00 PM but continue working until 5:00 PM to "finish the shift"

2. Improper break deductions: Company deducts 30 minutes for lunch break even when we work through lunch due to heavy shipment volume

3. Time clock manipulation: Manager told us to round down time entries to avoid overtime calculations

SUPPORTING EVIDENCE:
- Personal time logs maintained for 8 weeks
- Text messages from supervisor instructing off-the-clock work
- Photos of time clock showing actual hours vs. recorded hours
- Witness statements from coworkers Maria Santos and David Kim

REQUESTED REMEDIES:
1. Payment of all unpaid overtime wages at time-and-a-half rate
2. Liquidated damages equal to unpaid wages per 29 U.S.C. ยง 216(b)
3. Correction of timekeeping practices to comply with FLSA
4. Assurance of no retaliation for filing this complaint

I understand that the FLSA requires employers to pay overtime compensation at not less than one and one-half times the regular rate of pay for hours worked over 40 in a workweek. My employer's failure to pay proper overtime wages violates federal law.

I request immediate investigation and remediation of these violations.
